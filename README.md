# Overview

**Project Prompt:** The project prompt was for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown their inventory management system. Up to this point, 
the organization has been using spreadsheets to manually manage their inventory (adding inventory, deleting inventory, etc...), and recording other data on paper. 

The company has requested for a more sophisticated inventory management system to be developed.

The project for C482 Software 1 was to create an Inventory Management Application using Java and JavaFX + Scene Builder for the GUI. Overview of the applications functionality:
- The user can create Part and Product objects
- Part objects can be assigned to Product objects, but not required 
- Part and Product objects can be removed/deleted or modified 
- For any deletion of Part or Product objects, the user will be notified with a confirmation message if they want to proceed


Note: The design of the GUI was specified in the instructions for this class project, so there was not any room to design my own layout for the application. If I had to redo this project then I would design my own GUI and implement a database to keep the data persistent after closing down the application.
