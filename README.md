Tools: Java and JavaFX

The project for C482 Software 1 was to create an Inventory Management Application using Java and JavaFX + Scene Builder for the GUI. Overview of the applications functionality:
- The user can create Part and Product objects
- Part objects can be assigned to Product objects, but not required 
- Part and Product objects can be removed/deleted or modified 
- For any deletion of Part or Product objects, the user will be notified with a confirmation message if they want to proceed


Note: The design of the GUI was specified in the instructions for this class project, so there was not any room to design my own layout for the application. If I had to redo this project then I would design my own GUI and implement a database to keep the data persistent after closing down the application.
